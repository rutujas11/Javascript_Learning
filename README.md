# 🌐 JavaScript Learning Repository

Welcome to my JavaScript Learning Repository!  
This repository documents my journey of learning JavaScript from scratch. I will be covering all fundamental concepts, writing practice code, and organizing them topic-wise in folders.

## 📅 Today's Topics (29th July 2025)

### 1. 📌 Variables and Data Types  
Learned how to declare variables using `var`, `let`, and `const`, and explored different data types in JavaScript such as:  
- Strings  
- Numbers  
- Booleans  
- Null  
- Undefined  
- Objects

### 2. ⚙️ Operators and Conditional Statements  
Practiced different types of JavaScript operators:  
- Arithmetic Operators  
- Assignment Operators  
- Comparison Operators  
- Logical Operators  
- Unary & Ternary Operators  

Also explored conditional logic using:  
- `if`, `else`, `else if`  
- `switch` statement  
- Ternary operator

### 3. 🔁 Loops  
Learned how to perform repetitive tasks using different types of loops:  
- `for` loop  
- `while` loop
