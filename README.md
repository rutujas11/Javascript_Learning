# 🌐 JavaScript Learning Repository

Welcome to my JavaScript Learning Repository!  
This repository documents my journey of learning JavaScript from scratch. I will be covering all fundamental concepts, writing practice code, and organizing them topic-wise in folders.

### 1. 📌 Variables and Data Types  
Learned how to declare variables using `var`, `let`, and `const`, and explored different data types in JavaScript such as:  
- Strings  
- Numbers  
- Booleans  
- Null  
- Undefined  
- Objects

### 2. ⚙️ Operators and Conditional Statements  
Practiced different types of JavaScript operators:  
- Arithmetic Operators  
- Assignment Operators  
- Comparison Operators  
- Logical Operators  
- Unary & Ternary Operators  

Also explored conditional logic using:  
- `if`, `else`, `else if`  
- `switch` statement  
- Ternary operator

### 3. 🔁 Loops  
Learned how to perform repetitive tasks using different types of loops:  
- `for` loop  
- `while` loop  
- `do...while` loop  
- `for...of` loop  
- `for...in` loop  
- Used `break` and `continue` statements to control loop flow.

### 4. 🔤 Strings  
Explored string manipulation and built-in methods including:  
- Accessing characters (`charAt`, indexing)  
- Finding length  (`length`)
- Modifying (`slice`, `substring`, `replace`)  
- Case conversion (`toUpperCase`, `toLowerCase`)  
- Trimming whitespace (`trim`)  
- Concatenation (`concat`)
- template literals

### 5. 📦 Arrays  
Learned how to create and manipulate arrays. Covered concepts like:  
- Iterating through arrays (`for`, `for...of`, `forEach`)  
- Calculating average of numeric arrays  
- Applying discounts to items using loops  
- Using `splice`, `shift`, and `push` for modifying array contents  
- Real-world examples like price discounts and company name modifications

### 6. 🛠️ Functions  
Covered how to write reusable code using functions. Topics included:  
- Defining functions using `function` and arrow syntax  
- Counting vowels in a string (with both normal and arrow functions)  
- Using `forEach()` for array iteration  
- Filtering values in an array with `filter()`  
- Using `prompt()` for user input  
- Using `reduce()` to calculate sum and product of numbers in an array

## 📘 More Coming Soon...  
Stay tuned for updates as I continue learning and adding more topics like loops, functions, DOM manipulation, events, and more!
